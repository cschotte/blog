Hi, I'm **Clemens Schotte**, a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft, cloud architect, and passionate developer who has been shaping the future of technology for over two decades.

## What I Do Today

I lead product strategy for **[Azure Maps](https://azuremaps.com/)** at Microsoft, where I help developers and enterprises build location-aware applications that scale globally. My work spans from defining product roadmaps to enabling integrations with Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, and the broader Azure ecosystem. I'm particularly excited about bringing **geospatial intelligence to AI agents** through technologies like the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

When I'm not working on Azure Maps, you'll find me deep in code – building AI chat assistants, creating MCP servers, and exploring how tools like **GitHub Copilot** are transforming the way we develop software. I'm a firm believer that the best product managers write code, understand the developer experience firsthand, and stay close to the technical details.

## My Journey

My path in technology started in 2002 when I graduated from The Hague University with a degree in Information Sciences. I began as a software developer, crafting web solutions with PHP and C#, but my curiosity for emerging technologies quickly led me into consulting and technical evangelism.

I joined Microsoft in 2007 as an Application Platform Consultant and spent the next decade in various technical roles – from Senior Premier Field Engineer working with ISVs like Exact and SDL Tridion, to Senior Technical Evangelist driving adoption of Windows Phone Apps, Windows 8 Apps, Silverlight and Microsoft Edge. During this time, I delivered hands-on labs and workshops to thousands of developers across the Netherlands.

In 2017, I took a brief detour to Dropbox as a Solutions Architect, where I learned valuable lessons about enterprise collaboration and cloud adoption. But Microsoft called me back in 2019, and I've been here ever since, first as a Cloud Consultant helping organizations like ABN AMRO and Nokia with their digital transformations, and now leading product strategy for Azure Maps.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **AI, geospatial technology, and developer experience**. Whether it's building an Azure Maps MCP server that gives LLMs spatial intelligence, or creating a personal AI chat assistant for my blog using n8n on Azure Container Apps, I love solving real problems with elegant, composable solutions.

My approach is hands-on and pragmatic. I believe the best way to understand developer needs is to be a developer yourself. That's why I maintain active projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/cschotte), write detailed technical blog posts, and experiment with cutting-edge tools like GitHub Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and the latest AI frameworks.

## Technical Interests

- **Cloud Architecture**: Specializing in Azure services, particularly geospatial solutions, Container Apps, and serverless architectures
- **AI & Agents**: Building practical AI applications, MCP servers, and exploring how LLMs can be enhanced with real-time data
- **Developer Tools**: Deep expertise in Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot, and modern development workflows
- **Programming Languages**: Primarily C# and .NET, with explorations into Rust, Zig, and TypeScript
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and zero-touch deployment strategies

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding or strategizing about product roadmaps, I'm probably tinkering with my home network setup (featuring a Tesla Powerwall 2 and solar energy system), exploring new automation tools, or sharing insights through my blog and podcast appearances.

I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing. You'll often find me contributing to open-source projects, speaking at technical events, or mentoring fellow developers. I served on the Microsoft Netherlands Workers' Council from 2011-2014 and was an active board member of Computer Club Zeeland in my earlier years.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss Azure Maps, AI agents, developer tools, or any intersection of technology and real-world problem solving. You can find me on:

- **Blog**: [clemens.ms](https://clemens.ms) (where I share deep technical insights)
