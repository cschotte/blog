After two decades of turning ambitious technological visions into reality, **I'm ready for my next big challenge.**

## What I Bring to the Table

I've spent 25+ years at the intersection where cutting-edge technology meets real-world impact. At Microsoft, I transformed customer feedback to strategy for Azure Maps, a platform serving millions of developers globally, while pioneering the integration of geospatial intelligence into AI agents through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. But my journey spans much more than product management.

**I'm the rare technologist who codes, ships, and scales.**

From building custom CMSs that still run in production 20+ years later, to leading ABN AMRO's first Azure PaaS workload deployment, to evangelizing emerging platforms to audiences of 2,500+ developers, I don't just talk strategy, I execute it. My GitHub repos include AI chat assistants, MCP servers, and infrastructure automation that I use daily.

## The Unique Value I Deliver

**Technical Credibility That Drives Strategy**: When I define product roadmaps, it's backed by hands-on experience with C#, .NET, TypeScript, and emerging languages like Rust and Zig. When I advocate for developer tools like GitHub Copilot and VS Code, it's because I live in them daily. Product managers who code make better decisions.

**AI-First Mindset**: While others are still figuring out AI's potential, I'm building practical applications, from personal AI assistants running on Azure Container Apps to MCP servers that give LLMs spatial intelligence. I understand AI not as hype, but as a transformative tool that needs thoughtful product development.

**Scale Through Community**: I've built ecosystems, not just products. Whether delivering hands-on labs to thousands of developers, serving on Microsoft Netherlands Workers' Council, or creating content that reaches global audiences, I know how to turn individual users into thriving communities.

**Enterprise + Innovation Balance**: My experience spans from Dutch Tax Authority modernization to Nokia's Azure transformation to **Dropbox enterprise** adoption. I've seen what it takes to move large organizations while staying ahead of technology curves.

## The Impact I'm Looking For

I thrive at the convergence points that define the future of technology:

- **AI Product Strategy**: Where sophisticated AI capabilities meet intuitive developer and user experiences
- **Developer Relations at Scale**: Building bridges between cutting-edge tech and the developers who will define its success  
- **Cross-Platform Innovation**: Creating cohesive experiences across cloud, AI, and developer tools ecosystems
- **Technical Leadership**: Leading teams and initiatives that turn bold technical visions into market-defining products

## Why Now?

The industry is at an inflection point. AI is reshaping every aspect of how we build software, from code generation to autonomous agents. Geospatial intelligence is becoming critical for everything from supply chain optimization to autonomous vehicles. Developer experience is more important than ever as complexity increases.

**I want to be at the center of this transformation.**

Whether that means driving AI product strategy at a company pushing the boundaries of what's possible, leading developer advocacy for next-generation platforms, or heading up cross-functional initiatives that define new categories, I'm looking for opportunities where my unique blend of technical depth, product intuition, and community-building can create outsized impact.

## Let's Build the Future Together

If you're working on something that will matter in 5 years—not just next quarter, I want to hear about it. I bring:

✅ **Proven track record** leading products used by millions of developers  
✅ **Technical chops** that earn respect from engineering teams  
✅ **Strategic thinking** that balances innovation with business reality  
✅ **Global perspective** with enterprise and startup experience  
✅ **AI expertise** built through real implementations, not just theory  

The best technology companies aren't just building products, they're shaping how entire industries work. If you're doing that, especially in the AI, developer tools, or cloud space, let's explore how I can help turn your ambitious vision into market reality.
